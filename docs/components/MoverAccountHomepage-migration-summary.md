## Design System Integration

### Color Replacements

### Unchanged Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/api/drivers/${userId}/moving-partner-status` | Fetch driver's moving partner linkage status |

---

## Conditional Rendering Logic

### Driver View

**Always Visible**:
- Jobs
- Account Information (driver version)
- Coverage Area
- Best Practices

**Hidden if Linked to Moving Partner**:
- Work Schedule
- Vehicle Information
- Payment

### Mover View

**Always Visible**:
- Jobs
- Work Schedule
- Vehicle Information
- Account Information (mover version)
- Payment
- Coverage Area
- Best Practices

**Conditionally Enabled**:
- Driver Information (disabled until mover is approved)

---

## Migration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Route Updates
**Issue**: Old `/api/movers/` routes needed to be updated to `/api/moving-partners/`  
**Solution**: Updated to new migrated endpoint with proper error handling

### Challenge 2: Component Import Updates
**Issue**: Child components had been renamed with PascalCase  
**Solution**: Updated all imports to use migrated component names

### Challenge 3: Design System Integration
**Issue**: Multiple hardcoded color values throughout component  
**Solution**: Systematically replaced with semantic tokens from design system

### Challenge 4: Test Timing Issues
**Issue**: Initial tests failed due to async state updates  
**Solution**: Added proper `waitFor` blocks to ensure API calls complete before assertions

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- ✅ Efficient conditional rendering (no unnecessary re-renders)
- ✅ API calls only made when userId is provided
- ✅ Proper cleanup of fetch operations
- ✅ Minimal component re-renders

### Loading States
- ✅ Loading state managed during API calls
- ✅ Options hidden during loading to prevent flickering
- ✅ Graceful error handling

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Add skeleton loading states for better UX
2. Implement error boundary for API failures
3. Add retry logic for failed API calls
4. Consider caching approval/status data
5. Add analytics tracking for option clicks

### Maintenance Notes
- Keep API endpoints in sync with backend changes
- Update conditional logic if new user types are added
- Maintain test coverage as features evolve
