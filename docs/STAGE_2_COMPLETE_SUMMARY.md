## 🚀 Next Steps: Run Full Test Suite

### Why This Is Important
With Stages 1 and 2 complete, we need to:
1. **Measure actual progress** (how many tests now pass?)
2. **Identify remaining failures** (what's left to fix?)
3. **Categorize remaining issues** (API routes? Mocks? Edge cases?)
4. **Plan final fixes** (Stage 3 strategy)

### Expected Results After Stages 1 & 2
- **Stage 1**: Fixed ~90-120 tests (context providers)
- **Stage 2**: Fixed ~5-10 tests (import paths)
- **Total Fixed**: ~95-130 tests
- **Expected Pass Rate**: 97.5-99% (from 95.6%)

### Command to Run
```bash
cd /Users/calvinhemington/Desktop/boombox-workspace/boombox-11.0
npm test -- --passWithNoTests 2>&1 | tee test-results-stage2.log
```
