## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. ✅ Simple presentational components migrated quickly
2. ✅ Design system token replacement was straightforward
3. ✅ Test writing followed established patterns smoothly
4. ✅ No API routes or complex dependencies to handle

### Minor Issues Resolved
1. ⚠️ Import path issue: Initially used `@/tests/utils/accessibility`, fixed to `../utils/accessibility`
2. ⚠️ Apostrophe escaping: Fixed `renter's` to `renter&apos;s` in JSX
3. ⚠️ Quote escaping: Fixed `"Agreement"` to `&quot;Agreement&quot;` in JSX

### Best Practices Applied
- ✅ Systematic folder-by-folder approach
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for each component
- ✅ Accessibility-first testing
- ✅ Design system token usage throughout
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
