            <p>
                When loading your Boombox storage container in the San Francisco Bay Area, keep these four crucial concepts in mind to ensure your belongings are organized and secure:
            </p>
          <br />
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-6" style={{ listStylePosition: 'outside'}}>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <span className="font-semibold">Organize Your Items into Tiers:</span> Think of each tier as a wall or stack within the container, starting with the heaviest items at the bottom and lighter items on top. This method helps maintain balance and stability during transit.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <span className="font-semibold">Strategize Your Loading Process:</span> Begin your loading at the back of the container and move forward. The base of each tier, composed of your sturdiest items like dressers or desks, should support the weight of the items above.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <span className="font-semibold">Distribute Weight Evenly:</span> Place heavy items around the base of the container to evenly distribute weight, ensuring a stable and secure load.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <span className="font-semibold">Fill Gaps and Protect Items:</span> Utilize soft materials like furniture pads, blankets, and pillows to fill spaces between items, preventing shifts and scratches. Disassemble furniture to save space and wrap each piece to protect from damage.
                </li>

            <p>
                Packing your belongings with care is equally important. Here are some tips and guidelines to protect your items during the move:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6" style={{ listStylePosition: 'outside'}}>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Protect Your Electronics:</strong> For items like flat-screen TVs, using specialized moving boxes and padding them against cushioned surfaces can prevent damage.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Prevent Items from Shifting:</strong> Inside boxes, use bubble wrap, packing peanuts, or packing paper to fill any voids, keeping your items stationary and safe.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Choose the Right Box Sizes:</strong> Small boxes are ideal for heavy, compact items; medium boxes for larger appliances and lamp shades; and large boxes for bulky, lighter items like pillows and linens. These soft items can also be used to fill gaps in the container.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Specialty Boxes:</strong> Utilize specialty boxes for fragile items such as lamps, mirrors, and framed artwork to ensure they travel safely. Dishes and kitchenware should be packed in sturdy boxes with additional wrapping for protection.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Wardrobe Boxes for Clothing:</strong> To avoid wrinkles and damage, use wardrobe boxes for clothing that needs to remain hanging.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
                By following these guidelines, you can ensure your belongings are packed securely and arrive safely at your destination in the San Francisco Bay Area, making your move as smooth and stress-free as possible.

            Boombox arrives at your delivery location with a mobile storage unit. You can pack the unit yourself or get paired with local pros. If you want to remember the items you&apos;ve stored, we recommend taking photos of your stored items, which you can then upload later to your account page.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once your storage unit is packed, our Boombox delivery driver will return your unit to our secure storage facility.
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            The internal dimensions of our moving containers are approximately 56&quot; wide x 90&quot; long x 90&quot; high. Capacity is 257 cubic feet, holding up to 1,000lbs.

            <br />
            Each portable storage container has a large door for easy access and will typically accommodate an average room to a room and a half of household goods and furniture.

            - Disassemble furniture as much as you can, especially bedframes and table legs.

            - Label boxes to quickly identify them during unpacking.
            <br />
            - Wrap your furniture items in moving blankets and plastic to prevent them from being scratched.

        answer: (
          <>
            The best way to avoid shifting is to make sure your Boombox container is packed properly. Your heaviest items should be loaded towards the bottom center of the container and distributed evenly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please remember that each container can hold up to 1,000lbs. If you have a lot of heavy furniture, it is best to split it between multiple containers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another key is to fill any gaps with furniture pads or soft items to make sure there is no room for contents to shift.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are nervous that you won&apos;t be able to pack your container properly, no problem! Our network of local pros are more than capable of packing your container correctly.

            Of course. Security is one of our top priorities. Boombox storage locations are 24/7 monitored, and only authorized personnel are allowed on premises.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each storage unit is made of sturdy, steel construction and padlocked to ensure only you have access to your items.

            We always handle your storage unit with care; however, it is up to you to make sure your unit is packed properly to ensure no items shift during transit.
            <br />
            <br />
            We don&apos;t insure items that are damaged due to being improperly packed, but our comprehensive insurance coverage protects against any potential hazards in the unlikely event that they occur.

            For security purposes, our storage facilities are closed to the public. With Boombox you can always view your storage units online by logging in to your Boombox account.

            <br />
            Whenever you need a storage unit returned, just go online and schedule a drop-off. Or, if you need to add more stuff to your storage plan, you can book another unit delivery online as well.

            Your first month&apos;s storage bill is charged on the day your storage unit is delivered. Then your next bill is recurring every 30 days after your initial delivery.

            Billing is automatic so you don&apos;t have to worry about putting in your credit card information every month.
            <br />
            <br />
            Due to banking fees associated with automatic payments, we charge a payment processing fee of 3.5% of your total storage bill.

            Of course! All we ask is that you protect the furniture appropriately and that you let us know if your furniture item is over 100 lbs.
            <br />
            <br />
            To ensure your furniture is safe in transit, we recommend disassembling larger items such as bed frames and dining tables.

        answer: (
          <>
            Each unit has a strict weight limit of 1000lbs. Our mobile storage trailers are not designed
            to carry any weight over 1000lbs, and any additional weight can be dangerous for our drivers 
            or cause damage to your unit or trailer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Please let us know if you plan on storing a lot of heavy items (pallets of books, large furniture items, etc.).

        answer: (
          <>
            Labor costs depend on a couple of factors: the location of your delivery, the duration of 
            your move, and the date scheduled.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you need help during peak hours (weekends), labor will cost more.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will give as accurate an estimate as we can when you go through the website to get a quote.

            We pair you with local moving pros who are licensed and insured. Any damage or disputes 
            during your pickup should be handled directly with the moving company that helped load 
            your storage unit.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our insurance covers your items in transit as well as during storage, but not during 
            the moving process.
