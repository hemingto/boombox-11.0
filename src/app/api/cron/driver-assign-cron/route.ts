/**
 * @fileoverview Driver assignment retry cron job
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/api/driver-assign/cron/route.ts
 * @refactor Migrated to domain-based API structure with centralized utilities and validation
 * 
 * ROUTE FUNCTIONALITY:
 * This cron job runs every 15 minutes to check for driver assignments that have been sent 
 * but not accepted within the 2-hour time window. It automatically retries the assignment
 * by finding the next available driver and sending them a notification.
 * 
 * USED BY (boombox-10.0 files):
 * - Cron service configuration (external scheduler calls this endpoint)
 * - Admin dashboard may trigger manual retry (future implementation)
 * 
 * INTEGRATION NOTES:
 * - Requires CRON_API_SECRET environment variable for authentication
 * - Uses Onfleet API for driver assignments and task management
 * - Integrates with Twilio for SMS notifications to drivers
 * - Updates database records for tracking driver notification status
 * 
 * @refactor Extracted business logic to driverAssignmentUtils, added validation schema,
 * updated to use centralized database client and messaging patterns
