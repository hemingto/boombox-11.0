          Pack Smart
        </h2>

            We'll always handle your stuff with care, but you're responsible for ensuring your Boombox is packed properly. Please keep in mind the following to ensure your Boombox is properly packed:
          </p>
          <p
            class="mb-2"
          >
            <span
              class="font-bold"
            >
              1. Organize Your Items into Tiers:
            </span>
             Think of each tier as a wall or stack within the container, starting with the heaviest items at the bottom and lighter items on top. This method helps maintain balance and stability during transit.
          </p>
          <p
            class="mb-2"
          >
            <span
              class="font-bold"
            >
              2. Strategize Your Loading Process:
            </span>
             Begin your loading at the back of the container and move forward. The base of each tier, composed of your sturdiest items like dressers or desks, should support the weight of the items above.
          </p>
          <p
            class="mb-2"
          >
            <span
              class="font-bold"
            >
              3. Distribute Weight Evenly:
            </span>
             Place heavy items around the base of the container to evenly distribute weight, ensuring a stable and secure load.
          </p>
          <p
            class="mb-4"
          >
            <span
              class="font-bold"
            >
              4. Fill Gaps and Protect Items:
            </span>
             Utilize soft materials like furniture pads, blankets, and pillows to fill spaces between items, preventing shifts and scratches. Disassemble furniture to save space and wrap each piece to protect from damage.
          </p>
          <p
            class="mb-2"
          >
            Although not required, it is best practice that you disassemble furniture items (bed frames, tables) before loading them into your Boombox container. You'll ensure your items are transported safely while also freeing up space to pack more items.
          </p>
          <p
            class="mb-2"
          >
            If you plan on storing a mattress, we strongly recommend you cover it in a mattress cover. We can take mattresses without a cover, but it is best practice to keep mattresses covered to prevent damage over time.

            If you're storing items heavier than 50 pounds, give your moving crew a heads up to ensure they're ready for your larger pieces. For anything over 150lbs, please inform us. Each Boombox container can hold up to 2000lbs, and we can't transport containers exceeding this weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if you're moving from a hard-to-reach spot (like a 10th floor apartment), or if you're in a busy area with limited parking, let us know in advance so we can plan accordingly.
