# Boombox 11.0 - Clean Slate Refactoring PRD

## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Target:** Clean refactor from boombox-10.0 to boombox-11.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Objective

Refactor the entire boombox-10.0 codebase into a clean, modern boombox-11.0 structure while maintaining 99.9% functional compatibility. Focus on code organization, efficiency, maintainability, and readability.

### Strategy

- **Clean Slate Approach**: Build boombox-11.0 from scratch copying/refactoring code systematically
- **Atomic Tasks**: Break down work into 2-4 hour chunks for maximum AI assistance
- **Git-Based Safety**: Use git commits as primary safety mechanism (no complex backup systems)
- **Progressive Migration**: Complete one domain at a time, validate, then move to next

### Key Principles

1. **Preserve Functionality**: 99.9% functional compatibility required (if a change is a much better option, and makes the code more efficient, make your case and we will make a decision together)
2. **Modernize Structure**: Follow Next.js 15+ App Router best practices
3. **Maintain Dependencies**: Keep Onfleet, Stripe, Prisma, NextAuth exactly as-is
4. **Upgrade Safely**: Latest stable versions only if no functionality changes
5. **Design System**: Create organized Tailwind patterns and reusable components
6. **Efficiency Improvements**: Implement centralized systems (e.g., messaging templates) that improve maintainability without changing functionality
7. **Industry Standard Naming**: Follow Next.js and React best practices for file naming, with clear traceability from boombox-10.0 sources
8. **SEO & Accessibility First**: All refactored code must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and implement proper SEO practices
9. **Performance Optimization**: Target Core Web Vitals standards (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1) and optimize bundle size
10. **Image Optimization**: Replace ALL bg-slate placeholder divs with proper Next.js Image components for better performance, SEO, and accessibility
11. **Routing Optimization**: Replace complex client-side routing logic with industry-standard Next.js App Router patterns, eliminate unnecessary redirects, and implement proper route group organization

---

## 2. Current State Analysis

### Boombox-10.0 Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.1 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (shared with 11.0)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Payments**: Stripe with Connect
- **Logistics**: Onfleet integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Key Business Domains

1. **Authentication & User Management**
2. **Storage Services** (mobile storage units)
3. **Packing Supplies** (Onfleet delivery)
4. **Driver/Mover Management**
5. **Payment Processing** (Stripe)
6. **Admin Operations**
7. **Customer Portal**

### Issues to Resolve

- Components mixed in app directory (181 API routes need organization)
- Inconsistent file organization patterns
- Missing centralized type definitions
- No established component library patterns
- Limited testing infrastructure
- **Large bg-slate placeholder divs** throughout the codebase that should be replaced with optimized Next.js Image components (ask if unsure if the div is an image placeholder or not)
- **Complex admin routing logic** with string-parsing, client-side redirects, and duplicated routing patterns that violate Next.js best practices

## 4. Naming Conventions & File Mapping

### File Naming Standards

#### Component Files

- **Format**: PascalCase with descriptive, functional names
- **Pattern**: `{Domain}{Component}{Type}.tsx`
- **Examples**:
  ```
  ✅ UserAuthForm.tsx          (vs generic LoginForm.tsx)
  ✅ PackingSupplyOrderCard.tsx (vs generic OrderCard.tsx)
  ✅ OnfleetTaskStatus.tsx     (vs generic TaskStatus.tsx)
  ✅ StripePaymentForm.tsx     (vs generic PaymentForm.tsx)
  ```

#### Page Files (Next.js App Router)

- **Route Pages**: Always `page.tsx`
- **Layouts**: Always `layout.tsx`
- **Loading States**: Always `loading.tsx`
- **Error Boundaries**: Always `error.tsx`
- **Not Found**: Always `not-found.tsx`

#### API Route Files

- **Format**: `route.ts` (Next.js App Router standard)
- **Directory**: Descriptive kebab-case
- **Examples**:
  ```
  src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts
  src/app/api/payments/stripe-webhook/route.ts
  src/app/api/logistics/onfleet-webhook/route.ts
  src/app/api/customers/booking-request/route.ts
  ```

#### Utility and Service Files

- **Format**: camelCase with clear purpose
- **Pattern**: `{domain}{Purpose}.ts`
- **Examples**:
  ```
  ✅ onfleetApiClient.ts       (vs generic apiClient.ts)
  ✅ stripePaymentService.ts   (vs generic paymentService.ts)
  ✅ messageTemplateEngine.ts  (vs generic templateEngine.ts)
  ✅ customerValidationUtils.ts (vs generic validationUtils.ts)
  ```

#### Type Definition Files

- **Format**: Domain-based with clear scope
- **Pattern**: `{domain}.types.ts` or `{feature}.types.ts`
- **Examples**:
  ```
  ✅ onfleet.types.ts         (Onfleet API types)
  ✅ stripe.types.ts          (Stripe integration types)
  ✅ booking.types.ts         (Booking/appointment types)
  ✅ messaging.types.ts       (Message template types)
  ```

### File Mapping from Boombox-10.0

Each refactored file must document its source(s) using this format:

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview User authentication form component
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/components/login/LoginForm.tsx
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/components/signup/SignupForm.tsx (consolidated)
 * @refactor Consolidated login/signup into unified auth form with variants
 */
```

#### Common Consolidation Patterns

```typescript
// Single file refactor
/**
 * @fileoverview Onfleet task management service
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/api/onfleet/tasks/route.ts
 * @refactor Moved to domain-based API structure
 */

// Multiple file consolidation
/**
 * @fileoverview Centralized messaging service
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/lib/twilio.ts
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/lib/sendgrid.ts
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/api/send-email/route.ts
 * @refactor Consolidated messaging into template-based system
 */

// Component extraction
/**
 * @fileoverview Reusable button component
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/components/reusablecomponents/Button.tsx
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/components/admin/AdminButton.tsx (patterns)
 * @refactor Extracted into design system with consistent variants
 */
```

### Directory Naming Standards

#### Route Groups

```
src/app/
├── (public)/           # Public marketing pages
├── (auth)/             # Authentication pages
└── (dashboard)/        # Protected dashboard pages
```

#### API Organization

```
src/app/api/
├── auth/               # Authentication endpoints
├── payments/           # Stripe payment processing
├── orders/             # Appointments, packing supply orders
├── onfleet/            # Onfleet integration, tasks, webhooks
├── drivers/            # Driver management, availability
├── moving-partners/    # Moving partner operations
├── customers/          # Customer management, profiles
├── admin/              # Admin operations, reporting
└── webhooks/           # External webhook handlers (non-Onfleet)
```

#### Component Organization

```
src/components/
├── ui/                 # Design system components
│   ├── forms/         # Form-specific UI
│   ├── navigation/    # Navigation components
│   └── feedback/      # Alerts, toasts, modals
├── features/          # Business domain components
│   ├── auth/          # Authentication components
│   ├── orders/        # Booking/appointment, packing supply components
│   ├── payments/      # Payment form components
│   ├── onfleet/       # Onfleet integration components
│   ├── drivers/       # Driver management components
│   ├── moving-partners/ # Moving partner components
│   ├── customers/     # Customer management components
│   └── admin/         # Admin dashboard components
└── layouts/           # Page layout components
```

### Functional Naming Principles

1. **Descriptive over Generic**: `OnfleetTaskCard` vs `TaskCard`
2. **Domain Prefix**: Include business domain when relevant
3. **Action-Oriented**: `CreateBookingForm` vs `BookingForm`
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Use same suffixes (`Service`, `Utils`, `Types`)
5. **Avoid Abbreviations**: `customer` not `cust`, `appointment` not `appt`

### Migration Documentation Template

For each major refactoring task, create a mapping file:

```markdown
# TASK_NAME - File Mapping

## New Files Created

- `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` ← `boombox-10.0/src/app/components/reusablecomponents/Button.tsx`
- `src/lib/messaging/MessageService.ts` ← Consolidated from multiple files

## Files Consolidated

### MessageService.ts

- **Sources**:
  - `boombox-10.0/src/lib/twilio.ts`
  - `boombox-10.0/src/lib/sendgrid.ts`
  - `boombox-10.0/src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`
- **Reason**: Centralized messaging with template system

## Files Renamed

- `boombox-10.0/src/app/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx` → `src/components/features/admin/AdminUserManagement.tsx`
- **Reason**: Added domain prefix for clarity
```

**🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: All API routes successfully migrated with comprehensive utilities, validation schemas, and centralized architecture!

### **🚨 REDUNDANCY PREVENTION SYSTEM**

Before migrating any domain, use the systematic approach to prevent duplicate utilities:

#### **Pre-Migration Analysis** (Required for each domain):
```bash
# 1. Analyze domain utilities before migration (30 min)
npm run migration:analyze <domain-name>

# 2. Check cross-domain duplicates (15 min)  
npm run migration:check-duplicates

# 3. Plan utility placement and consolidation (10 min)
# Review: docs/api-migration-prevention-strategy.md
```

#### **Migration Execution** (Per route):
- ✅ **Check existing utilities first**: Import from `@/lib/utils/index.ts`
- ✅ **Reuse before creating**: Follow analysis recommendations  
- ✅ **Document new utilities**: Add @source comments and update exports
- ✅ **Verify no duplicates**: Run `npm run migration:check-duplicates` after domain

## 5. API Route Migration Pattern & Checklist

### **Standardized Migration Steps for API Routes**

Based on successful migrations of `accessStorageUnit` and `addAdditionalStorage`, follow this **6-step pattern** for consistent, high-quality route migrations:

#### **Step 0: Pre-Migration Analysis** ⏱️ 10-15 minutes
- [ ] **Redundancy Check**: Run `npm run utils:scan-duplicates` to check current state
- [ ] **Domain Analysis**: Run `npm run migration:analyze <domain-name>` per **🚨 REDUNDANCY PREVENTION SYSTEM**
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis**: Check all imports in source route for missing services/utilities
  - Example: `import { findOrCreateRouteForOrders } from '@/lib/services/route-manager'`
  - Check if `route-manager.ts` exists in `boombox-11.0/src/lib/services/`
- [ ] **Service Dependencies**: Copy any missing service files from `boombox-10.0/src/lib/services/` to `boombox-11.0/src/lib/services/`
  - Update import paths to boombox-11.0 structure (e.g., `@/lib/database/prismaClient`)
  - Add proper `@source` documentation headers
- [ ] **Update Service Exports**: Add new services to `@/lib/services/index.ts` exports

#### **Step 1: Analyze Source Route** ⏱️ 15-30 minutes
- [ ] Examine original route in `boombox-10.0/src/app/api/[routeName]/route.ts`
- [ ] Identify inline functions that can be extracted (messaging, validation, utilities)
- [ ] Document dependencies, integrations (Onfleet, Stripe, Prisma), and business logic
- [ ] Note any complex state management or error handling patterns

#### **Step 2: Create Messaging Templates** ⏱️ 15-20 minutes
- [ ] Extract inline messaging logic to `@/lib/messaging/templates/sms/booking/[templateName].ts`
- [ ] Follow `MessageTemplate` interface: `text`, `requiredVariables`, `channel: 'sms'`, `domain: 'booking'`
- [ ] Use template variable syntax: `\${variableName}` for dynamic content
- [ ] Update template exports in `@/lib/messaging/templates/sms/booking/index.ts`

#### **Step 3: Create/Update Utility Functions** ⏱️ 30-45 minutes
- [ ] Add business logic functions to `@/lib/utils/appointmentUtils.ts`
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for data structures (follow existing patterns)
- [ ] Ensure proper `generateJobCode()` integration and database transactions
- [ ] Preserve exact business logic while extracting into reusable functions
- [ ] Handle async operations and error cases properly

#### **Step 4: Add Validation Schemas** ⏱️ 10-15 minutes
- [ ] Create Zod validation schema in `@/lib/validations/api.validations.ts`
- [ ] Pattern: `Create[RouteName]RequestSchema` with proper type handling
- [ ] Use existing validation patterns: `z.string().or(positiveIntSchema)` for flexible inputs
- [ ] Include all required and optional fields from original route

#### **Step 5: Create Migrated Route** ⏱️ 45-60 minutes
- [ ] New route in `@/app/api/orders/[route-name]/route.ts`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Use comprehensive documentation header with source mapping and usage notes
- [ ] Import centralized utilities: `MessageService`, appointment utilities, validation schemas
- [ ] Replace inline functions with centralized utilities and templates
- [ ] Preserve exact business logic, error handling, and response formats
- [ ] Use proper TypeScript type conversions: `parseInt(String(value), 10)`
- [ ] Test async operations don't block responses: `.catch()` for background processing

#### **Step 6: Add Refactor Tracking & Update PRD** ⏱️ 3-5 minutes
- [ ] Add `@REFACTOR-P9-*` tracking comments for any placeholder/temporary code
- [ ] Mark route as completed: `- [x]` in `REFACTOR_PRD.md`  
- [ ] Add completion details and any notes about changes made
- [ ] Run `npm run refactor:scan` to verify tracking comments are detected

#### **Step 7: Post-Migration Verification** ⏱️ 2 minutes
- [ ] Run `npm run utils:scan-duplicates` to verify no new duplicates created
- [ ] Confirm all utilities imported from centralized locations
- [ ] Update domain completion status if all routes in domain are finished

### **Quick Migration Checklist Template**

**For AI assistants**: Use this checklist for any API route migration:

```markdown
## Route Migration: [ROUTE_NAME]

### Pre-Migration Analysis
- [ ] Source route analyzed: `boombox-10.0/src/app/api/[routeName]/route.ts`
- [ ] Dependencies identified: [list integrations, services, utilities]
- [ ] Service dependencies copied: [list any services copied from boombox-10.0/src/lib/services/]
- [ ] Inline functions identified: [list extractable functions]

### Step-by-Step Migration
- [ ] **Step 1**: Source analysis complete
- [ ] **Step 2**: SMS template created and exported
- [ ] **Step 3**: Utility functions added to appointmentUtils.ts
- [ ] **Step 4**: Zod validation schema added
- [ ] **Step 5**: New route created with documentation
- [ ] **Step 6**: PRD tracking updated

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All business logic preserved (99.9% compatibility)
- [ ] Error handling maintained or improved
- [ ] TypeScript types properly handled
- [ ] Async operations don't block responses
- [ ] SMS messaging uses centralized templates
- [ ] Database operations use proper transactions
- [ ] Route documentation includes source mapping
```

---

### **File Structure Pattern**

Every migration should create/modify these files:
1. `@/lib/messaging/templates/sms/booking/[templateName].ts` - SMS template
2. `@/lib/messaging/templates/sms/booking/index.ts` - Template exports  
3. `@/lib/utils/appointmentUtils.ts` - Business logic utilities
4. `@/lib/validations/api.validations.ts` - Validation schemas
5. `@/app/api/orders/[route-name]/route.ts` - Migrated route
6. `REFACTOR_PRD.md` - Updated tracking

---

### **Quality Standards**

- **Functional Compatibility**: 99.9% preserved functionality
- **Code Organization**: Centralized utilities, no inline business logic
- **Dependency Management**: All service dependencies copied and available before route migration
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces and validation
- **Documentation**: Source mapping and comprehensive route docs
- **Error Handling**: Standardized responses, proper async handling
- **Performance**: No blocking operations, efficient database transactions

---

## 6. API Route Documentation Template

When refactoring API routes in Phase 4, each route file must include comprehensive documentation comments at the top of the file following this template:

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview [Brief description of API route functionality]
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/api/[original-path]/route.ts
 *
 * ROUTE FUNCTIONALITY:
 * [Detailed description of what this route does, including HTTP methods supported]
 *
 * USED BY (boombox-10.0 files):
 * - src/app/components/[component-path]/[ComponentName].tsx (line X: specific usage context)
 * - src/app/[page-path]/page.tsx (line Y: specific usage context)
 * - [Additional files that call this API route]
 *
 * INTEGRATION NOTES:
 * - [Any special notes about external service integrations like Stripe/Onfleet]
 * - [Critical business logic that must be preserved]
 * - [Security/authorization requirements]
 *
 * @refactor [Description of any organizational changes made during refactor]
 */
```

### Example Documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Stripe customer creation with payment method attachment
 * @source boombox-10.0/src/app/api/stripe/create-stripe-customer/route.ts
 *
 * ROUTE FUNCTIONALITY:
 * POST endpoint that creates a new Stripe customer and attaches a payment method.
 * Sets up customer with shipping address and default payment method for invoicing.
 *
 * USED BY (boombox-10.0 files):
 * - src/app/components/getquote/getquoteform.tsx (line 345: Customer registration during quote submission)
 *
 * INTEGRATION NOTES:
 * - Critical Stripe integration - DO NOT modify payment logic
 * - Creates SetupIntent for off-session payments
 * - Requires paymentMethodId from Stripe Elements on frontend
 *
 * @refactor Moved from /api/stripe/ to /api/payments/ structure
 */
```
