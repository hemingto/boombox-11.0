# Cursor Rules for Boombox 11.0 Migration

## Transition Guidelines

When migrating components from boombox-10.0 to boombox-11.0:

1. **DO NOT add transitions that were not in the original component**
   - Only preserve transitions that existed in the original boombox-10.0 component
   - Common original transitions: `transition-colors`, `transition-transform`, `transition-all` (rare)
   - AVOID adding `duration-200`, `duration-300`, or any duration classes unless they existed in the original

2. **Preserve original transition patterns**:
   - **RadioCard**: Originally had NO transitions → Keep minimal (only `transition-colors` if needed for hover states)
   - **RadioList**: Originally had `transition-colors` → Keep `transition-colors` only
   - **Input components**: Originally had NO transitions → Keep NO transitions
   - **Buttons/Cards**: Check original for `transition-transform` or `transition-colors`

3. **When in doubt, check the original**:
   - Always reference the original component in `boombox-10.0/src/app/components/reusablecomponents/`
   - Match the exact transition behavior, don't enhance unless explicitly requested

## Examples of what NOT to do:
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Adding transitions that weren't in original
className="transition-all duration-200 hover:scale-105"

// ❌ WRONG - Adding duration when original only had transition-colors  
className="transition-colors duration-200"
```

## Examples of what TO do:
```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT - Matching original transition-colors only
className="transition-colors"

// ✅ CORRECT - No transitions if original had none
className="bg-white hover:bg-gray-50"
```

This preserves the original performance characteristics and user experience.
